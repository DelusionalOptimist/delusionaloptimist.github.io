I'm a generalist (or wannabe-generalist) software engineer from India working in the cloud native landscape.

I'm very enthusiastic about open source software and have significantly contributed to numerous projects.

In my early-early years I served as an open source maintainer for Meshery, a CNCF sandbox project for service mesh management and parallely worked upon the SMI project as an LFX mentee in fall 2021 during which I helped improve the spec's adoption by creating a widely used GitHub action.

Currently I'm an SWE at AccuKnox where I'm working on everything from low level linux primitives to building in-house control planes from scratch.

You'll mostly find me writing Go or Python. Sometimes I hack and stick stuff together using shell scripts but I totally hate that with passion : )...
I've done plenty of fiddling around with tools like Kubernetes, Docker and whatnot.
