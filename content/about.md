Hey! I'm Rudraksh Pareek. I also go by the nick DelusionalOptimist.

I'm a final year undergrad engineer from India studying Computer Science and actively contributing to the cloud native landscape.

I'm very enthusiastic about open source software and have significantly contributed to numerous projects.

I've served as an open source maintainer for Meshery, a CNCF sandbox project for service mesh management.
I've also worked on the SMI project as an LFX mentee in fall 2021 during which I helped improve the spec's adoption by creating a widely used GitHub action.

I'm currently an SWE intern at AccuKnox where I'm working on KubeArmor, a CNCF project focused on container runtime security.

Most of the software I've worked on has involved working with DevOps tools, Linux containers and Cloud platforms and has given me the experience both as a Backend and DevOps engineer. I program in Go, Python or Java and work with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools, Helm, Terraform and others.
