However, what to use and how effective will it be is subject to the application&amp;rsquo;s environment.
eBPF is a powerful mechanism which is being used commonly for security usecases these days. It provides deep observability by directly instrumenting the OS kernel. However, a side effect of this is the need of privileged access of some form in the system.
It is also noteworthy that cloud platforms recently have started to abstract away infrastructure, hiding many configuration knobs, so that users can have a more smoother and secure experience.</description></item><item><title>Reddit for you</title><link>https://delusionaloptimist.github.io/posts/reddit-for-you/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://delusionaloptimist.github.io/posts/reddit-for-you/</guid><description>Reddit is a great place which if used wisely can work as a great source of information of all sorts. This blog highlights some good subreddits for people who like computers/programming/tech in general. Rather than being a mega subreddit list, this is a curated list that I and some other folks at JODC find interesting.
My two cents There are many other great subreddits that this post may not include, one of the reason being they are very specific to the reader&amp;rsquo;s interest (or maybe I am unaware of them :P) and I leave it upto the reader to find them.</description></item></channel></rss>
