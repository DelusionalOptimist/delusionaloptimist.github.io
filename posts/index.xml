&lt;p>There are several mechanisms for protecting applications at runtime. However, what to use and how effective will it be is subject to the application&amp;rsquo;s environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>eBPF is a powerful mechanism which is being used commonly for security usecases these days. It provides deep observability by directly instrumenting the OS kernel. However, a side effect of this is the need of privileged access of some form in the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is also noteworthy that cloud platforms recently have started to abstract away infrastructure, hiding many configuration knobs, so that users can have a more smoother and secure experience. An example is AWS Fargate. Available to use with ECS and EKS clusters, it abstracts away the underlying EC2 instances by adding it&amp;rsquo;s own agent in the usual container data plane and further isolates by running single workload per instance. It also restricts certain primitives as an attempt to keep the enviornment secure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reddit for you</title><link>https://delusionaloptimist.github.io/posts/reddit-for-you/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://delusionaloptimist.github.io/posts/reddit-for-you/</guid><description>&lt;p>Reddit is a great place which if used wisely can work as a great source of information of all sorts. This blog highlights some good subreddits for people who like computers/programming/tech in general. Rather than being a mega subreddit list, this is a curated list that I and some other folks at &lt;a href="https://jiitodc.netlify.app/">JODC&lt;/a> find interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-two-cents">My two cents&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many other great subreddits that this post may not include, one of the reason being they are very specific to the reader&amp;rsquo;s interest (or maybe I am unaware of them :P) and I leave it upto the reader to find them. Some general advice on finding good communities for your needs and making most out of them:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
