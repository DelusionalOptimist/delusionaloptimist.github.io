This blog highlights some good subreddits for people who like computers/programming/tech in general. Rather than being a mega subreddit list, this is a curated list that I and some other folks at JODC find interesting.
My two cents There are many other great subreddits that this post may not include, one of the reason being they are very specific to the reader&amp;rsquo;s interest (or maybe I am unaware of them :P) and I leave it upto the reader to find them.</description></item></channel></rss>
