&lt;p>There are several mechanisms for protecting applications at runtime. However, what to use and how effective will it be is subject to the application&amp;rsquo;s environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>eBPF is a powerful mechanism which is being used commonly for security usecases these days. It provides deep observability by directly instrumenting the OS kernel. However, a side effect of this is the need of privileged access of some form in the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is also noteworthy that cloud platforms recently have started to abstract away infrastructure, hiding many configuration knobs, so that users can have a more smoother and secure experience. An example is AWS Fargate. Available to use with ECS and EKS clusters, it abstracts away the underlying EC2 instances by adding it&amp;rsquo;s own agent in the usual container data plane and further isolates by running single workload per instance. It also restricts certain primitives as an attempt to keep the enviornment secure.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
